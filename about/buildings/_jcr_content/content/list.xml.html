<div class="vt-text  " data-emptytext="Text"><p>Located at the corner of Perry Street and West Campus Drive, the $42 million three-story, 73,400-square-foot building contains 15 state-of-the-art classrooms and four interdisciplinary teaching laboratories with seats for more than 1,450 students, as well as study rooms and group meeting space. The new learning spaces are designed to support increasingly interactive and technology-driven learning experiences.</p>

<p>The classrooms have features that include moveable furnishings, wall-mounted writing spaces, and multiple screens for projecting shared material and student work. Some rooms were configured as SCALE-UP classrooms, a specific design that facilitates team-based, active learning as an alternative to lectures, even for large-enrollment classes.</p>

<p>The building includes rooms that can be subdivided and readily reconfigured as the instructional needs, technologies, and teaching methods change over time.</p>

<p>The new building was constructed to LEED certification standards, a designation given by the U.S. Green Building Council for structures that use the very best in energy and environmental design.</p>

<p>The location of the Classroom Building adjacent to other instructional buildings is intended to minimize travel time between classes for students and faculty. The location is also convenient to students commuting from off-campus.</p>

<p>EYP Architecture &amp; Engineering of Washington, D.C., designed the building, and WM Jordan Company Inc. of Newport News was the construction manager.</p>

<p>Phase I of construction was a $14 million project that was funded by Virginia Tech with nongeneral funds.

<div class="vt-text  " data-emptytext="Text"><p>Davidson Hall is named for Robert James Davidson, who came from South Carolina College in 1891, beginning as Adjunct Professor of Chemistry and Chemist to the Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station. At the close of the session of 1893-1894, he was advanced to a full professorship. Ten years later, he was made Dean of the Department of Applied Sciences. He was a member of the Washington Academy of Science, a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a member of the American Chemical Society, and a member of the National Association of Official Agricultural Chemists, serving as its President in 1903. In 1909, he was a delegate to the International Congress of Applied Chemistry at London. Davidson died very suddenly at his home on the campus of the Institute on the morning of Sunday, December 19, 1915. In 1927, as the new building was nearing completion, a recommendation was made to the Board of Visitors and approved to name the building for Davidson. As noted in the report of the president at the time, &quot;He was respected and admired by his colleagues, he was held in affection by his students, and he was greatly appreciated by the farmers of Virginia to whom he was a valuable advisor.&quot;</p></div>

    	<buildingHistory><![CDATA[ 
<div class="vt-text  " data-emptytext="Text"><p>Former Athletic Director Jim Weaver identified a new practice facility as a need not long after being hired in the fall of 1997. In 1998, he received permission to build the facility from then-president Paul Torgersen, but other facilities needs took precedence at the time, putting the project temporarily on hold.</p>
<p>Over the next decade, the athletics department built the south end zone structure at Lane Stadium and then a new structure on the west side of the stadium. The department also constructed a basketball practice facility, a new football locker room, a new Olympic sports weight room, and it embarked on several other smaller projects.</p>
<p>Movement on the practice facility project began again in earnest in 2012, but finding a site proved problematic as the university and the athletics department worked out issues related to finding a location.</p>
<p>In September 2014, a building and grounds committee of the Board of Visitors approved the site with all sides coming to an agreement that the best place for the facility was on part of the existing football practice fields – specifically, the east practice field adjacent to the football locker room.</p></div>

The hazing of rats (first-year cadets) seems to have blossomed in Barracks No. 1 since the building layout created an environment for upperclassmen to develop “extracurricular controls” over the rats. The barracks housed 130 students until it was converted to academic office use in 1967, ending 78 years of use as barracks. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.</p></div>

<div class="vt-text  " data-emptytext="Text"><p>Construction on a stadium to seat 35,000 started in 1964 and by 1969 most major construction had been completed. The work cost $2,113,047. It was first used Sept. 24, 1965, for a freshman football game between Virginia Tech and University of Maryland, which ended in 8-8 tie. The first varsity game was Virginia Tech vs. the College of William and Mary on Oct. 2, 1965, with Tech winning 9-7.</p>
<p>In 1971 an area underneath the cantilevered press box was glassed in to seat members of the Golden Hokie Club. Additional 26,768-square-foot bathroom area and concourse on the east side was completed 1977. An additional 12,500 seats (new tier on one side) were installed in 1981 at a cost of $3.17 million.</p>
<p>A modern lighting system was added 1982 and then replaced in 2005. The first night game was played Nov. 25, 1982. A new scoreboard was installed in 1991 and then replaced with a Jumbotron 2005. The auxiliary scoreboard on the north end was added in  1994.</p>
<p>Permanent bleachers were added 1999. The expansion of south end zone, adding 11,120 seats and enclosing south end zone, came in 2002 and cost $37 million. The old press box was removed in 2004.</p>
<p>The west end stands addition was completed in 2006. It brought another 11,000 seats -- including 1,160 bleacher seats with backs, 1,200 club seats, and 15 luxury suites -- plus improved visitors’ locker room, a high-tech media center, and new press area added for $52.5 million.</p></div>

<div class="vt-text  " data-emptytext="Text"><p>Construction on Lee Hall was started in 1965 and completed in fall 1966. </p>
<p><i>During the 125th anniversary of Virginia Tech, students in a history class came across a page in the 1896 Bugle listing Lee as a leader in the campus chapter of the KKK. After a thorough investigation in 1997, it was determined that there was the potential that the organization was a hoax and that the hall name would not be changed. It was recognized that Lee's potential participation was reprehensible.The issue resurfaced in October 2004. The Commission on Equal Opportunity and Diversity was asked to look into the situation and develop a set of recommendations. This set of recommendations was approved in February 2005 and subsequently adopted by the University. The recommendations called for broader education on the subject of Claudius Lee and also for strengthening diversity efforts across the university.</i></p></div>

    	<buildingHistory><![CDATA[ 
<div class="vt-text  " data-emptytext="Text"><p>Two students thought during the 1894-1895 term that (then) V.P.I. should have a Young Men's Christian Association Building and they set about to make it happen. A effort to raise funds was started; about two years into the project, Mr. Lawrence Priddy became involved and from then on the project was almost entirely his responsibility. In a 1913 report on the history of the building, it was stated that, &quot;without his tireless energy the work could not have gone on.&quot; Priddy worked to raise subscriptions and donations for the construction, so that, according to the report, &quot;In the spring of 1899 the plans for the building were prepared by Mr. W. F. West, an architect of Richmond, Virginia, and were finally adopted, after Mr. Priddy had obtained the advice and suggestions of the leading authorities on Y. M. C. A. work in this country. At the time the design was considered a model for a college Y. M. C. A. Building.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1900, with appropriate and imposing ceremonies, the cornerstone was laid in the presence of a large body of interested spectators. The speakers on this occasion were Dr. R. S. McArthur, the noted divine of New York; Dr. J. M. McBryde, the President of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute; and Mr. Lawrence Priddy, of New York, whom Dr. McArthur characterized as &quot;the most consistent, persistent, and insistent beggar I have ever seen.&quot;</p>
<p>The building was pushed to rapid completion by Mr. Wesley Gray, the contractor, being built of native limestone [known today as Hokie Stone] and trimmed with sandstone brought from Ohio. With the exception of the trimming, all the building material came from the State of Virginia.&quot; (<cite>Bulletin of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute</cite>, October 1913, Volume VI, No. 4, pp. 44-46)</p>
<p>The YMCA offices moved out in 1937, and the building was known as the Military Building until the late 1960s when it became the Student Personnel Building. It was named the Performing Arts Building in the 1970s. That name was later changed to the Liberal Arts Building.</p>
<p>The YMCA in 1972 deeded any interest it had in the building to Virginia Tech as part of the university’s centennial observances.</p></div>

Another 10,614-square-foot addition was added during the last remodel in 1995 to convert it from a residence hall to academic use for a number of departments in the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences.</p>

According to Williams's report, he &quot;told him to 'go to hell.' &quot; Williams was gassed and wounded in the battle and died when a shell exploded nearby as he was being evacuated.</p>

<p>In her advocacy work, Moss, who is dyslexic, has cited her personal story of struggling in school until an open-minded teacher recognized her artistic potential. Moss wound up enrolling in a high school for the fine arts and, later, in New York’s Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art.</p>
<p>“The arts can change people’s hearts, change their minds, and change their lives,” Moss said. “I was lucky enough to find them at a young age, and they opened up so many learning avenues and professional opportunities for me. That is why I am so excited about the impact this wonderful facility will make on thousands of people, young and old, across this entire region of our state.”</p>

<p>The rooms and hallways are designed for cadets and their training needs, such as floor tiles in the hallways that are colored and spaced to help cadets practice marching and a mud room that allow cadets to properly clean equipment after outdoor training.</p>

<p>Both buildings’ basement levels contain a kitchen and laundry room for cadets and offices for Corps’ staff. Additionally, New Cadet Hall includes a gym, as well as workspace for the Corps’ physical trainer.</p>

<p>Between the two residence halls is a new plaza featuring an 80-foot flagpole and a maroon-brick sidewalk that forms the largest “VT” on campus to connect Lane, Pearson, and New Cadet halls.<br />

<div class="vt-text  " data-emptytext="Text"><p>The rare old-growth urban forest near Lane Stadium on the campus of Virginia Tech covers approximately 11.5 acres. It contains over 250 large trees, including dozens of white oak trees that have been estimated by scientists to be over 300 years old. The woods are unofficially referred to as Stadium Woods. In a spot surrounded by pavement and concrete buildings, Stadium Woods absorbs rainwater and cools the vicinity in summer. The 2009 Virginia Tech Master Plan Amendment identifies the site as an environmental and cultural greenway, defined as “a significant reservation of lands, waterways, tree stands, and cultural landmarks for future generations.”</p>

<p>Research has shown the old-growth urban forest to have a balanced, uneven-aged structure, which is rare, particularly for forests in urban settings. Evaluations reveal consensus in perspectives among stakeholders in that this forest patch, as the only untouched greenspace left on campus proper, has historical, educational, and research importance. The forest provides significant ecosystem services and is ecologically unique and rare. It reflects and contributes to the importance of the region’s natural environment as a premium example of a white oak late successional primeval forest community.</p>

<div class="vt-text  " data-emptytext="Text"><p>The building has been the home for Virginia Tech’s presidents, with one exception, since its completion in 1902. The first inhabitant was President John M. McBryde, who lived there from 1902 to 1907. All presidents after McBryde lived there until 1971, when President T. Marshall Hahn Jr. constructed a private residence in Blacksburg, Va., and moved off campus. His successor, William E. Lavery, lived in the off-campus house during his entire term. Several departments used the facility until it was remodeled in 1987-88 to serve again as the home for university presidents and renamed The Grove. President James D. McComas moved into it in 1988, becoming its first presidential inhabitant since Hahn. It was last renovated (including the addition of new garage) in 2000.</p>
